Register accesses: 33135-33150

Normal poll cycle: 1 min (register reads every 5 min)

EXCEPT for odd intervals (~1 per day?) where its like some sort of reset occurs causing
an access to occur at any time, then have a cycle (or 2) of differing timings followed by 
6 cycles where two of the register write cycles are occurring at 01:12 minute followed by
00:44 second intervals.

Now I've made the app more robust to decode errors, a longer run between 08/11 thru to 11/11
shows this behaviour occurring 24hrs apart (in this instance ~03:15am). 
On 09/11 the normal register read cycle is interrupted after the read at 33075, with an 11s 
delay followed by read of 35000 after which the normal register reads restart.
On 10/11 it occurs shortly after a register write, after which the normal register reads restart.
On 11/11 the normal register read cycle is interrupted after the read at 33104, with an 11s
delay followed by read of 35000 after which the normal register reads restart.

Note that in trace from 05/11, this was happening at 04:13am whilst on 04/11, it was at 11:28am. So
can shift around *for some reason*.

Key thing though is it's not (as I thought), the write which kicks this off but an unexpected read of
35000 which can occur seemingly any time. Following that you then get the differently timed (and content)
writes.

TODO: Determine the behaviour when the wifi adaptor is first connected.
